# Mobile Signing Issue - Debug Log

## The Problem

On mobile (Android Chrome), after successfully connecting a wallet via Dynamic.xyz + WalletConnect:
- Wallet connection succeeds ✅
- User sees connected state briefly
- Backend authentication requires message signing
- **Automatic deep link to MetaMask doesn't trigger** ❌
- User sees grey screen / loading state
- If user **manually** opens MetaMask app, signature request is there and works fine ✅
- After manual signing, authentication completes successfully ✅

## Expected Behavior

WalletConnect on mobile should automatically trigger deep link to MetaMask app when signing is requested, so the user doesn't have to manually open the app.

## Critical Discovery (Commit 9620c08)

In commit `9620c0854612fe3bc433415e57dc2eff108d2eea`, we achieved a state where:
1. ✅ Wallet connection worked
2. ✅ Signing request was sent to MetaMask
3. ✅ User could manually open MetaMask and sign
4. ✅ Backend authentication completed successfully
5. ❌ **ONLY MISSING**: Automatic deep link redirect to MetaMask app

This proves the signing mechanism itself works - the ONLY issue is the automatic deep link not triggering.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Stale Connection Detection (WORKING)
After page reload, Dynamic detects stale wallet connection and forces fresh reconnect:
```
[WARN] [DynamicBridge] Stale connection detected - cannot extract provider, forcing logout
```
This part is **working correctly** - it clears the stale connection before showing the modal.

### Fresh Connection (SUCCEEDS)
User reconnects wallet fresh and connection succeeds:
```
[INFO] [AuthManager] ✅ Connection successful
```
This part also **works fine**.

### Message Signing (FAILS)
Even with fresh connection, signing fails when we try to authenticate:
```
[ERROR] [DynamicProvider] Message signing failed
```

## Attempted Fixes

### THE WORKING STATE (Commit 9620c08) ⭐
**Date**: First successful attempt
**Code**:
```typescript
const eip1193Provider = await connector.getWalletClient?.() || connector.provider;
const browserProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(eip1193Provider);
const signer = await browserProvider.getSigner();
const signature = await signer.signMessage(message);
```
**Result**: ✅ Signing WORKS (when user manually opens MetaMask)
**Issue**: ❌ Automatic deep link to MetaMask doesn't trigger
**Key insight**: This proves signing works - we just need to trigger the deep link

### Attempt 1: Use Dynamic's connector.signMessage() (AFTER 9620c08)
**Date**: Trying to fix deep link issue
**Code**:
```typescript
await this.dynamicWallet.connector.signMessage(message, { address })
```
**Result**: ❌ Failed completely
**Error**: "getSigner is not a function"
**Why it failed**: Regressed from working state - Dynamic's connector.signMessage() doesn't work at all

### Attempt 2: Access protected _connector.getProvider()
**Date**: Trying to get WalletConnect provider for deep linking
**Code**:
```typescript
const internalConnector = (this.dynamicWallet as any)._connector;
const provider = await internalConnector.getProvider();
```
**Result**: ❌ Failed
**Error**: "Internal connector does not have getProvider() method"
**Why it failed**: Even the protected _connector doesn't expose getProvider()

### Attempt 3: Use wagmi's getConnectorClient()
**Date**: Trying to get connector through wagmi API
**Code**:
```typescript
const connectorClient = await getConnectorClient(wagmiConfig);
const browserProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(connectorClient);
```
**Result**: ❌ Failed
**Error**: "n.connector.getChainId is not a function"
**Why it failed**: `getConnectorClient()` calls `connector.getChainId()` which doesn't exist on Dynamic's connector

### Attempt 4: Back to connector.signMessage() (CIRCULAR) ⚠️
**Date**: Just now (regression!)
**Code**: Same as Attempt 1
**Result**: Not deployed yet, but will regress to same failure as Attempt 1

## Current Committed Code State

Latest commits:
1. `1ce3fe3` - "Use Dynamic's built-in signMessage API directly" (Attempt 4 - circular)
2. `a452152` - "Remove unused getConnectorClient import"

**This is the same approach that failed in Attempt 1.**

## Key Observations

1. **Dynamic's Architecture**:
   - `wallet.connector` = Limited public interface
   - `wallet._connector` = Still a Dynamic wrapper, not raw wagmi
   - Neither provides direct access to underlying WalletConnect provider

2. **Wagmi Assumptions**:
   - All wagmi APIs (`getConnectorClient`, `getWalletClient`) assume connector has methods like `getChainId()`, `getProvider()`
   - Dynamic's connector wrappers don't implement these methods
   - Wagmi connector state may be broken/incomplete after reconnect

3. **Stale Connection Pattern**:
   - Page reload → stale wallet reference in Dynamic
   - Stale detection works correctly
   - Fresh reconnect succeeds
   - **But connector state is still broken for signing**

## What We Haven't Tried

1. **Skip Dynamic's abstraction entirely** - Access wagmi connectors directly from wagmi config state, bypassing Dynamic's wrapper completely

2. **Force complete cleanup** - When detecting fresh connection is needed, completely clear wagmi state, not just Dynamic state

3. **Use viem directly** - Create viem client from wagmi config without going through Dynamic at all

4. **Investigate connector state** - Check what's in `wagmiConfig.state.connections` after fresh reconnect to see if the connector is actually valid

## Questions to Answer

1. What does `wagmiConfig.state.connections` contain after a fresh reconnect?
2. Can we access the raw wagmi connector from wagmi state instead of through Dynamic?
3. Is Dynamic's `DynamicWagmiConnector` properly syncing the connector to wagmi state?
4. Does the connector work for signing BEFORE we try to use it, or does it only break when called?

## Next Steps

Need to decide between:
1. **Debug the connector state** - Figure out why the fresh connector is broken for signing
2. **Bypass Dynamic completely** - Access wagmi/viem directly for signing operations
3. **Report to Dynamic** - This might be a bug in their DynamicWagmiConnector integration

## Timeline Context

We've been working on this mobile authentication issue for approximately **one week** with **15-minute build/test cycles** for each attempt.

# COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS - 2025-10-20

## What We Did

**Reverted to commit 9620c08** - The working state where signing succeeds but automatic deep linking doesn't trigger.

**Conducted thorough research** of:
1. Reown AppKit type definitions and configuration options
2. WalletConnect UniversalProvider source code
3. EthersAdapter implementation
4. Mobile deep linking mechanisms in WalletConnect packages
5. The actual request flow from ethers → BrowserProvider → WalletConnect

## Critical Discoveries

### 1. The Real Root Cause

**THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE SIGNING MECHANISM** - that works fine at commit 9620c08.

**THE PROBLEM IS**: After connection, WalletConnect doesn't automatically trigger redirects to the wallet app for subsequent requests (signing, transactions, etc.).

**Why this happens:**
- Connection flow uses AppKit's modal UI which actively manages deep linking ✅
- After connection, when you call `signer.signMessage()`:
  - Request goes through: ethers → BrowserProvider → WalletConnect provider
  - WalletConnect sends request over the relay network
  - **Automatic deep link redirect doesn't fire** because session already exists
  - On mobile, wallet app is in background, so user never sees the request ❌

**Proof it's not the signing:**
- Manual signing works perfectly when user opens wallet themselves
- Request reaches the wallet successfully
- Signature is valid and authentication completes

**It's ONLY the automatic redirect that's broken.**

### 2. Deep Links vs Universal Links Analysis

**Universal Links** (HTTPS URLs like `https://metamask.app.link/...`):
- ✅ More seamless UX (no "Open in app?" prompts)
- ✅ Fallback to web if app not installed
- ✅ Preferred by iOS/Android
- ❌ Can fail silently if server configuration is wrong
- ❌ Require server-side setup by wallet provider

**Deep Links** (Custom schemes like `metamask://...`):
- ✅ More reliable when app is installed
- ✅ Fail obviously (user sees error) if broken
- ✅ Don't require server configuration
- ❌ Show explicit browser prompts ("Open in MetaMask?")
- ❌ Can't fallback to web

**AppKit Configuration Found:**
```typescript
experimental_preferUniversalLinks?: boolean  // Default: true
```

### 3. Why We're Keeping Universal Links (Not Switching to Deep Links)

**Initial thought**: Maybe universal links are failing silently, switch to deep links.

**Why that's wrong**:
1. ✅ **Connection already works** - Universal links ARE working for initial connection
2. ✅ **Proven functional** - The redirect mechanism (whatever type) works fine during connection
3. ❌ **Not a link type problem** - The issue is NO redirect fires at all for post-connection requests

**Conclusion**: The link type (universal vs deep) is fine. We just need to **trigger** the redirect.

### 4. Architecture Insights - How WalletConnect Handles Mobile

From WalletConnect SignClient source code, found these functions:
- `getDeepLink()` - Retrieves the deep link for a wallet
- `handleDeeplinkRedirect()` - Triggers the redirect
- `getLinkModeURL()` - Generates link mode URLs
- `WALLETCONNECT_DEEPLINK_CHOICE` - LocalStorage key for wallet preference

**Deep linking IS implemented in WalletConnect** - but only fires automatically during certain flows (like initial connection via modal).

**Session metadata structure:**
```typescript
provider.session.peer.metadata = {
  name: "MetaMask",
  description: "...",
  url: "https://metamask.io",
  icons: ["..."],
  redirect: {
    native: "metamask://",           // Deep link
    universal: "https://metamask.app.link/..."  // Universal link
  }
}
```

This metadata is ONLY available on WalletConnect sessions (not injected wallets, not desktop extensions).

## What We Dismissed and Why

### ❌ Dismissed: Switching to Deep Links

**Why**:
- Universal links already work for connection
- Not a link type issue - it's a "no redirect at all" issue
- Changing to deep links would give worse UX when it does work

### ❌ Dismissed: Using provider.request() directly instead of ethers

**Why**:
- Would require rewriting entire app to not use ethers
- Breaks architectural principle of provider-agnostic code
- Signing works fine through ethers - not the bottleneck

### ❌ Dismissed: Trying to fix Dynamic.xyz connector wrappers

**Why**:
- The problem exists even at the ethers/WalletConnect level
- Dynamic's abstraction isn't the issue (switching to Reown proved this)
- Would be fighting Dynamic's architecture unnecessarily

### ❌ Dismissed: Modifying WalletConnect's internal behavior

**Why**:
- WalletConnect is working correctly (sends requests, receives responses)
- Problem is higher in the stack (automatic redirect triggering)
- Would be monkey-patching node_modules (unmaintainable)

## The Solution: Provider Wrapper with Multi-Layer Protection

### Approach

**Wrap the WalletConnect provider BEFORE passing to ethers.BrowserProvider**

The wrapper:
1. Implements same EIP-1193 interface (transparent to ethers)
2. Intercepts user-action requests (signing, transactions)
3. Triggers deep link redirect BEFORE sending request
4. Passes request through to original provider

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Preserves ethers-based architecture (no app-wide changes)
- ✅ Fixes ALL interactions (signing, transactions, network switching)
- ✅ Only affects mobile WalletConnect (desktop/injected wallets untouched)
- ✅ Uses wallet's preferred redirect type (universal or deep)
- ✅ Graceful fallback (if redirect fails, request still works)

### Critical: Multi-Layer Protection

**MUST ensure wrapper only affects: Mobile + WalletConnect + External Wallets**

**Layer 1 - Device Check:**
```typescript
if (!deviceInfo.isMobile && !deviceInfo.isTablet) {
  return provider  // Skip desktop entirely
}
```

**Layer 2 - WalletConnect Session Check:**
```typescript
if (!provider?.session) {
  return provider  // Skip injected wallets (no WalletConnect session)
}
```

**Layer 3 - Peer Metadata Check:**
```typescript
if (!provider.session?.peer?.metadata) {
  return provider  // Skip if no peer info
}
```

**Layer 4 - Redirect Capability Check:**
```typescript
const { redirect } = provider.session.peer.metadata
if (!redirect?.native && !redirect?.universal) {
  return provider  // Skip if wallet doesn't provide redirect URLs
}
```

### What Each Layer Protects Against

| Scenario | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | Wrapped? |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----------|
| Desktop + MetaMask extension | ❌ | - | - | - | No |
| Desktop + WC QR → Mobile wallet | ❌ | - | - | - | No |
| Mobile + MetaMask mobile browser | ✅ | ❌ | - | - | No |
| Mobile + Injected wallet | ✅ | ❌ | - | - | No |
| Mobile + WC → External wallet | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **YES** |
| Farcaster connections | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | No (different code path) |

### Implementation Points

**File**: `/utils/mobileDeepLinkProvider.ts`
- New utility function `wrapProviderWithMobileDeepLinks(provider)`
- Multi-layer protection checks
- Intercepts user-action methods: `personal_sign`, `eth_sendTransaction`, etc.
- Triggers redirect: `window.location.href = redirect.native || redirect.universal`
- Small delay (300ms) to let redirect process
- Returns modified provider with same EIP-1193 interface

**File**: `components/auth/reownWalletConnect.tsx`
- Call wrapper in `createEIP1193Provider()` method
- Apply wrapper BEFORE adding disconnect capability
- Pass wrapped provider to ethers.BrowserProvider

**File**: `CLAUDE.md` (documentation)
- Updated with restriction: NEVER run builds or git commits

## What We Learned

### About WalletConnect Architecture

1. **Session metadata is key** - Contains all redirect URLs for deep linking
2. **Redirects work differently for connection vs requests** - Connection has active UI managing redirects, requests don't
3. **Provider.session only exists for WalletConnect** - Injected wallets don't have this structure
4. **Multiple redirect types available** - Wallets provide both native (deep) and universal links

### About ethers.js Integration

1. **BrowserProvider is a thin wrapper** - Doesn't interfere with underlying provider's request() method
2. **EIP-1193 interface is the contract** - As long as we implement `request()`, ethers doesn't care what's underneath
3. **Wrapping is transparent** - Can intercept requests without breaking ethers' abstraction

### About Mobile Wallet UX

1. **Background app problem** - Wallet apps don't stay foreground between connection and usage
2. **Silent request problem** - Requests sent over relay don't automatically bring app to foreground
3. **Manual workaround exists** - Users CAN manually open wallet and see pending requests (proves signing works)
4. **Automatic redirect is UX polish** - The mechanism works, just needs triggering

## Testing Strategy

After implementing the wrapper:

1. **Desktop Chrome + MetaMask Extension**
   - Expected: No change (wrapper skipped)
   - Test: Connect, sign, transaction

2. **Desktop Chrome + WalletConnect QR → Mobile MetaMask**
   - Expected: No change (wrapper skipped on desktop)
   - Test: Connect, sign, transaction

3. **Mobile Chrome + MetaMask Mobile App**
   - Expected: Automatic redirects work
   - Test: Connect (should already work), sign (should now auto-open), transaction (should now auto-open)

4. **Mobile Safari + Rainbow Wallet**
   - Expected: Automatic redirects work
   - Test: Same as above

5. **Mobile + Farcaster**
   - Expected: No change (different code path)
   - Test: Verify authentication still works

## Why This Time Will Be Different

**Previous attempts failed because:**
- We were trying to fix the signing mechanism (which wasn't broken)
- We were fighting framework abstractions (Dynamic, wagmi)
- We were looking in the wrong layer (connector wrappers, not providers)

**This approach will succeed because:**
- ✅ We identified the actual problem (missing redirect trigger)
- ✅ We're working with the architecture (wrapping provider, not replacing it)
- ✅ We're fixing at the right layer (before ethers, after WalletConnect)
- ✅ We have proper safeguards (multi-layer protection)
- ✅ Solution is minimal and surgical (one wrapper, one call site)

## Key Principle Learned

**"Fix the smallest thing at the right layer"**

- ❌ Don't rewrite the whole auth flow
- ❌ Don't switch frameworks
- ❌ Don't bypass abstractions
- ✅ Identify the exact missing piece (redirect trigger)
- ✅ Add it at the right place (provider wrapper)
- ✅ Preserve everything else that works

---

**Status**: Ready to implement wrapper solution
**Confidence**: High - thorough research completed, root cause identified, protection layers defined
**Risk**: Low - highly targeted change with multiple safeguards

# IMPLEMENTATION - 2025-10-20

## Starting Point

**Git SHA**: `9620c0854612fe3bc433415e57dc2eff108d2eea`

**What works at this commit:**
- ✅ Wallet connection succeeds
- ✅ Signing request reaches MetaMask wallet
- ✅ User can manually open MetaMask and sign
- ✅ Backend authentication completes successfully

**What's broken:**
- ❌ Automatic deep link to MetaMask doesn't trigger
- ❌ User stuck on loading/grey screen
- ❌ User must manually open wallet app to see request

## Changes Being Implemented

### New File: `/utils/mobileDeepLinkProvider.ts`

**Purpose**: Wrap WalletConnect provider to trigger mobile deep links before user-action requests

**Implementation**:
1. **Multi-layer protection** (4 layers) to ensure wrapper only affects mobile WalletConnect external wallets
2. **Request interception** for user-action methods (signing, transactions, network switching)
3. **Deep link triggering** via `window.location.href` before sending request
4. **Comprehensive logging** for debugging in production

**Key function**: `wrapProviderWithMobileDeepLinks(provider)`
- Input: WalletConnect provider (from AppKit)
- Output: Same provider with request() method wrapped
- Interface: EIP-1193 compatible (transparent to ethers.js)

### Modified File: `components/auth/reownWalletConnect.tsx`

**Change location**: `createEIP1193Provider()` method

**Before**:
```typescript
createEIP1193Provider() {
  const walletProvider = this.getProvider()
  const provider = {
    ...walletProvider,
    disconnect: async () => { ... }
  }
  return provider
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
createEIP1193Provider() {
  const walletProvider = this.getProvider()

  // Wrap with mobile deep link support BEFORE adding disconnect
  const mobileAwareProvider = wrapProviderWithMobileDeepLinks(walletProvider)

  const provider = {
    ...mobileAwareProvider,
    disconnect: async () => { ... }
  }
  return provider
}
```

**Why this location**:
- Provider is wrapped BEFORE being passed to ethers.BrowserProvider
- Affects ALL blockchain operations (signing, transactions) automatically
- No changes needed elsewhere in the app

## Expected Outcome

After deployment:
- ✅ Mobile + WalletConnect + External wallet → Automatic deep links work
- ✅ Desktop + Any wallet → No change (wrapper skipped)
- ✅ Mobile + Injected wallet → No change (wrapper skipped)
- ✅ Farcaster → No change (different code path)

User experience on mobile:
1. User connects wallet → Works as before
2. User initiates signing → **Deep link automatically opens wallet app** (NEW)
3. User signs in wallet → Works as before
4. User returns to browser → Authentication completes (as before)

The **only** difference is step 2 - automatic redirect instead of manual wallet opening.

---

# SECOND IMPLEMENTATION - 2025-10-20 (CORRECTED)

## Problem with First Implementation

**Deployed Git SHA**: `4a4f380`

**What happened:**
- ❌ The wrapper solution was implemented in `components/auth/reownWalletConnect.tsx`
- ❌ But the app actually uses **Dynamic.xyz**, not Reown WalletConnect
- ❌ Logs showed `[DynamicProvider]` everywhere, not `[ReownWalletConnect]`
- ❌ The wrapper was never executed because Reown code path wasn't being used

**Evidence from logs:**
```
[DynamicProvider] Creating signer directly from wallet connector
[DynamicProvider] Signing message with direct signer
✅ Message signed successfully at 00:50:03.144Z
```

The signing completed successfully, but no automatic deep link opened MetaMask - exactly the same problem we were trying to fix.

## Root Cause of Implementation Error

**Why the mistake happened:**
1. During research and planning, we focused on Reown/WalletConnect architecture
2. The research was correct - WalletConnect DOES have session metadata with redirect URLs
3. The wrapper solution design was correct - intercept requests and trigger redirects
4. **BUT** we implemented it in the wrong provider (Reown instead of Dynamic)
5. Dynamic.xyz ALSO uses WalletConnect underneath, but through its own abstraction layer

## The Corrected Implementation

**Starting Point**: Git SHA `4a4f380` (previous failed attempt)

### Changes Being Made

**File**: `lib/auth/providers/DynamicProvider.ts`

**Location**: Both `signMessage()` and `signTransaction()` methods

**Before**:
```typescript
// Get the EIP-1193 provider from the connector
const eip1193Provider = await connector.getWalletClient?.() || connector.provider;

// Create ethers provider and signer
const browserProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(eip1193Provider);
const signer = await browserProvider.getSigner();
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Get the EIP-1193 provider from the connector
const eip1193Provider = await connector.getWalletClient?.() || connector.provider;

// Wrap provider with mobile deep link support BEFORE creating ethers provider
// This ensures mobile wallets automatically open when signing is requested
const wrappedProvider = wrapProviderWithMobileDeepLinks(eip1193Provider);

// Create ethers provider and signer
const browserProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(wrappedProvider);
const signer = await browserProvider.getSigner();
```

**Why this location:**
- Dynamic.xyz creates the provider in `DynamicProvider.ts`, NOT in Reown code
- The `eip1193Provider` is the actual WalletConnect provider (when using external wallets)
- Wrapping here affects ALL signing and transaction operations through Dynamic
- The wrapper's multi-layer protection still applies (mobile + WalletConnect session + peer metadata + redirect URLs)

## Will the Wrapper Work with Dynamic's Provider?

**Yes, because:**

1. **Same underlying structure** - Dynamic uses WalletConnect for external wallets
2. **EIP-1193 interface** - The provider still implements `request()` method
3. **Session metadata exists** - WalletConnect sessions have `session.peer.metadata.redirect`
4. **Multi-layer protection works** - All 4 protection layers apply equally:
   - Layer 1: Device detection (mobile vs desktop)
   - Layer 2: WalletConnect session check (external vs injected)
   - Layer 3: Peer metadata check (valid session)
   - Layer 4: Redirect capability check (wallet provides URLs)

**The wrapper doesn't care that it's Dynamic** - it only checks for WalletConnect session structure, which Dynamic exposes when using external wallets.

## What Gets Protected from Wrapping

| Scenario | Wrapped? | Why? |
|----------|----------|------|
| Desktop + Any wallet | No | Layer 1: Not mobile |
| Mobile + MetaMask injected browser | No | Layer 2: No WalletConnect session |
| Mobile + Dynamic embedded wallet | No | Layer 2: No WalletConnect session |
| Mobile + WC → MetaMask external | **YES** | All 4 layers pass |
| Farcaster connections | No | Different provider entirely |

## Expected Outcome

This time the fix should work because:
- ✅ Wrapper is applied in the actual code path being used (Dynamic, not Reown)
- ✅ Wrapper is applied to the correct provider (Dynamic's EIP-1193 provider)
- ✅ Wrapper is applied at the right time (before creating BrowserProvider)
- ✅ Multi-layer protection ensures only mobile WalletConnect external wallets affected

**After deployment:**
1. User connects wallet on mobile → Works as before
2. User initiates signing → **Deep link should automatically open MetaMask** (FIXED)
3. User signs in MetaMask → Works as before
4. User returns to browser → Authentication completes

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify which code path is actually executing** - Don't assume based on architecture research
2. **Check logs to confirm provider type** - The `[DynamicProvider]` logs immediately showed we were in the wrong place
3. **Research != Implementation location** - Understanding WalletConnect architecture was valuable, but implementation had to be in Dynamic's code
4. **The wrapper solution was correct** - Just needed to apply it in the right place

---

**Status**: Corrected implementation ready to deploy
**Confidence**: High - wrapper is now in the actual code path that executes
**Next**: Deploy and test on mobile with Dynamic + WalletConnect + MetaMask

---

# LOGGING FIX - 2025-10-20

## Problem Discovered

After deploying commit 4a4f380, the wrapper appeared not to be executing because ZERO logs from `[MobileDeepLink]` appeared in the mobile debug output.

## Root Cause

The wrapper WAS executing, but we couldn't see it because:
- **Wrapper used `console.log()`** - Only visible in browser console (not accessible on mobile)
- **Mobile logger uses `mLog`** - Sends logs to backend API for remote viewing
- **Solution**: Replace all `console.log()` calls in wrapper with `mLog.*()` calls

## Changes Made

**File**: `utils/mobileDeepLinkProvider.ts`

1. Added import: `import { mLog } from './mobileLogger'`
2. Replaced all `console.log()` → `mLog.info()`
3. Replaced all `console.warn()` → `mLog.warn()`
4. Ensured all wrapper execution is now visible in mobile debug logs

## Expected Result

After redeployment, we should see detailed logs showing:
- Layer 1-4 protection checks
- Whether wrapper is applied or skipped
- Every request interception
- Deep link triggering for user actions
- Success/failure of deep link redirects

This will allow us to definitively confirm:
1. Is the wrapper being executed?
2. Are the protection layers working correctly?
3. Is the deep link actually being triggered?
4. Is the redirect URL correct?

---

**Status**: Logging fix ready for deployment
**Next**: Deploy and analyze mobile logs to see wrapper execution

---

# LAYER 2 FAILURE - PROVIDER WRAPPING ISSUE - 2025-10-20

## Problem Discovered (farcaster-test-v37.2.19)

After deploying the logging fix, we can now see the wrapper executing! But logs show:
```
[MobileDeepLink] ✓ Layer 1 passed: Mobile/tablet device detected
[MobileDeepLink] ⏭️  No WalletConnect session - likely injected wallet, skipping wrapper
```

**Layer 2 is FAILING** - The wrapper can't find the WalletConnect session.

## Root Cause Analysis

The provider from `connector.getWalletClient?.() || connector.provider` is NOT the raw WalletConnect provider - it's been wrapped by viem/wagmi.

**Provider Chain:**
```
connector.getWalletClient()
  → Returns viem WalletClient (wrapper)
    → Contains transport property
      → Contains the actual WalletConnect UniversalProvider
        → Has .session property with deep link URLs
```

The WalletConnect `session` property is buried several layers deep, so our direct check `provider?.session` returns `undefined`.

## Solution

Modified the wrapper to search through the provider chain for the WalletConnect session:

**File**: `utils/mobileDeepLinkProvider.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Added provider chain search logic
2. Check multiple common paths: `provider.transport.provider`, `provider.provider`, `provider.transport.value`, etc.
3. Use the found WalletConnect provider (`wcProvider`) for session metadata
4. Added debug logging to show which paths were checked

**Search paths checked:**
- `provider` (direct)
- `provider.transport.provider` (viem transport wrapper)
- `provider.provider` (common wrapper pattern)
- `provider.walletProvider` (some connectors use this)
- `provider.transport.value` (alternative viem path)

This should allow the wrapper to find the WalletConnect session regardless of how deeply it's nested in the provider chain.

---

**Status**: Provider chain search implemented
**Next**: Deploy and test - should pass Layer 2 now and find WalletConnect session
